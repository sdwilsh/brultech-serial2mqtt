    Vanilla TCPSite accepts only str as host. However, the underlying asyncio's
    create_server() implementation does take a list of strings to bind to multiple
    host IP's. To support multiple server_host entries (e.g. to enable dual-stack
    explicitly), we would like to pass an array of strings. Bring our own
    implementation inspired by TCPSite.

    Custom TCPSite can be dropped when https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/4894
    is merged.
