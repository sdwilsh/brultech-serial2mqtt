This package contains components that can be plugged into Home Assistant.

Component design guidelines:
- Each component defines a constant DOMAIN that is equal to its filename.
- Each component that tracks states should create state entity names in the
  format "<DOMAIN>.<OBJECT_ID>".
- Each component should publish services only under its own domain.
